                        The reason I am interested in this field, it has a variety of sub fields that can pursue by an undergraduate student. 
                        In this degree there are many specializations such as Internet of things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Network 
                        Design, Software Development, Game Development, Date Science, and more. <br><br> Computer science can be described as the study
                        of computers and computational systems which deals mostly with the theory, design, development, applications, 
                        algorithms, data structures of the software system. In this field, Artificial Intelligence would be my favorite topic 
                        since it deals with machine learning and more programming in it. However, specializing in that field and pursuing it 
                        is a challenge.

                        When we were small watching movies, most of the scenarios we did see were robots are acting, end of the day they would save the earth and ultimately, they are the heroes. As we see now, there is a rapid increase in technology where they bring new innovations thus AI is one of the latest concept scientists brought out and now these robots which we thought they were fiction have stepped in to the human beings’ lives. In  a nutshell, without describing what AI actually mean, I would say in the near future robots would take over our day to day activities. How awesome is that? 
                        <br> <br> According to the researches, the concept of Artificial Intelligence was first brought out by John McCarthy in 1956 during his first academic conference. Since then, many projects were made such as Siri, Alexa, AlphaGo, Google Brain, etc. More projects can be viewed in the given link above named ‘AI Projects’.

                        This is one of the main projects created by Apple Inc, ‘Siri.’ This concept is created by using the AI technology and this was implemented to the apple iPhone 4S in 2011. Later on, the voice assistant was implemented to the rest of the apple devices. Using machine learning technology allows Siri to play multiple functions. In fact, it also allows the user to change Siri’s voice making comfortable for the user to use. Having this facility in user’s phone has change their lives as it does the action whenever a user speaks up. Saying ‘Hey Siri!’ allows to activate Siri and then it listens to what user says. 
                        <br> <br>As Apple is renowned for its quality assurance  and thinking ahead compared to other tech companies, in 2016 Apple has enhanced the feature giving Siri to access third-party apps such as messaging apps, payment apps, internet calling apps but up to limited apps as Apple is also considered to be the best security provider for its customers. Having these features has led a major change in humans’ lives.
